Title: Toolkit for Basic Analysis of Single-Cell and RNA-seq Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jakub Kubis - JBioSystem; Laboratory of Single Cell Analyses, IBCH, PAS
Maintainer: JBioSystem <jbiosystem@gmail.com>
Description: A comprehensive toolkit designed for the basic analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data without cell barcodes,
    relying solely on unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Developed within the Laboratory of Single-Cell Analyses at the 
    Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, PAS, in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. 
    Core functionalities include:
    - Merging matrices from featureCounts.
    - Quality control of cell content to identify and exclude low-quality data.
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
    - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for visualization.
    - Clustering for group identification within datasets.
    - Marker selection to identify key features for cell types or states.
    - Visualization tools to facilitate exploration and presentation of results.
    scRNAbaseR empowers researchers to perform essential preprocessing, analysis, and visualization 
    tasks on scRNA-seq and RNA-seq datasets in a straightforward and efficient manner.
